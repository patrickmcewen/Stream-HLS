Steps to install as codesign submodule:
1. follow the instructions in README to install ampl and activate your license.
2. Make sure you don't have the codesign conda environment activated for initial build because the cmake version will be too old
3. run build-streamhls.sh (modified to automate most of the install steps including conda environment creation)
